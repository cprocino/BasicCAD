this week I made my caster whole. Useing onshape assembly I put together my caster and made it work.
This is the link to what i did https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/5497b322d31d227e8369d3d7/w/80c83b54972f2718ba46f811/e/f5b2fa02a6f92f5c6d8cb02b.

the hard part was the very begging trying to extrude and assemble the parts but it was easy once I started to go back and look at the lessons but I need to remember to 
build things the right wat first and in the right place.
